# Assignment 1: Fundamentals of Neural Networks and Music Genre Classification

## Overview
This repository contains Assignment 1 for the Selected Topics in Data Science course. The assignment focuses on the fundamental theoretical concepts of neural networks and their practical application to a music genre classification problem using the FMA dataset.

## Contents
The assignment is divided into two main parts:

### Theoretical Exercises (PDF):
- Matrix operations and broadcasting in NumPy.
- Analysis of network architectures and L1 regularization.
- Gradient calculation and development of equations for backpropagation.
- Summary and opinion of the Daphne Oram essay.

### Computational Exercise (Jupyter Notebook):
- Exploratory analysis and dimensionality reduction of audio features.
- Data preprocessing (standardization, scaling, etc.).
- Design and training of a neural network in PyTorch to classify music genres.
- Model evaluation and generation of predictions for the test set.

## Getting Started
To run the computational part of the assignment:

1. Ensure you have all the .csv files from the dataset in the same directory as the notebook or in an accessible path.
2. Open the Assignment1_Name_LastName.ipynb file in a Jupyter or Google Colab environment.
3. Install the dependencies listed in the Requirements section.
4. Run the cells in order to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas (for handling the .csv files)
- Scikit-learn (for preprocessing and dimensionality reduction)
- PyTorch (for the neural network implementation)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
